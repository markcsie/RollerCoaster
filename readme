This program was developed in Ubuntu 16.04.
Please install the following libraries before compiling and running.
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

usage:
cd hw2-starterCode/
make
./hw2 <track file>

Note that files other than "hw2.cpp" were also modified slightly.
Please compile the project with all files in the zip file.
If you are using vmware to run this code, there might be a bug using opengl texture. (https://communities.vmware.com/thread/537924?start=0&tstart=0)

Basic requirements for this homework:
1. This program uses the OpenGL core profile, version 3.3, and shader-based OpenGL.
2. Properly render Catmull-Rom splines to represent your track.
3. Render a texture-mapped ground and sky.
4. Render a rail cross-section.
5. Move the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path and orientation along the coaster.
6. Render the coaster in an interesting manner (good visibility, realism).
7. Run at interactive frame rates (>15fps at 1280x720)
9. The source code is commented as detailed as possible.
10. 1000 animation images are stored in animation/


Extras:
1. Render double rails (like in real railroad tracks).
2. Render cross bars.
3. Generate the track from several different sequences of splines (multiple track files)
4. Draw splines using recursive subdivision (vary step size to draw short lines) instead of using brute force (vary u with fixed step size).
5. Modify the velocity with which the camera moves to make it physically realistic in terms of gravity.
6. The cross bars and rails are also texture-mapped.
